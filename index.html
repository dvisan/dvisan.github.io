                        <p>Anyway, I have a <a href="http://dvisan.me" target="_blank">resume</a>.&nbsp;<br>And of course I have an account on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danvisan/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(with the poker face version of the photo on this page)</span>.&nbsp;<br>And
                            surely, I post my photos on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dsvi" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>.&nbsp;<br>And, amazingly, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88770957-dan" target="_blank">I even read books</a>.<br></p>
                        <p>And that paragraph above could've been a simple buletted list, but it's not. Because I chose to make it confusing. Exactly like your opinion about me right now. At least the links open in new tabs, you ungrateful millennial.<br></p>
